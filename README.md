# Pong with Enhanced Gameplay

This Pong game in Unity adds exciting twists to the classic formula!

## Description

Pong, a timeless video game, is back with a twist! Originally developed by Atari in 1972, it captivated players with its simple yet addictive gameplay. In this Unity rendition, you'll experience:

* **Classic Pong Mechanics:** Control your paddle on one side of the screen, deflecting a ball against your opponent (human or AI) to score points.
* **Increasing Ball Speed:** Rack up impressive hits â€“ the faster you react and strike the ball, the more its velocity increases, adding a layer of strategic challenge.
* **Bidirectional Shooting Paddles:** Unleash a new dimension of control! Hold a designated button (configurable in the options menu) to temporarily extend your paddle's reach in either direction, allowing for more precise intercepts and powerful shots.

## Features

* Smooth ball physics for realistic bounces and deflections.
* Engaging gameplay for casual and competitive players alike.
* Intuitive controls for both paddles and bidirectional shooting.
